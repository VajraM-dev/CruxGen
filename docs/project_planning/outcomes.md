Upon successful completion, the SynthDataGen project will deliver the following tangible outcomes and assets:

**1\. Software Deliverables:**

* **Core Python Library:** A well-structured Python package containing all the logic for document processing, Q\&A generation, and database interaction.  
* **Python SDK:** A high-level Software Development Kit (SDK) that provides simple, programmatic access to the system's capabilities for easy integration into other applications.

**2\. Data & Storage Deliverables:**

* **Populated PostgreSQL Database:** A running database instance containing the generated Q\&A pairs, source document information, and all related metadata, structured according to the defined schema.  
* **Standardized JSON Export:** The system will produce a dataset in a JSON file format (e.g., JSON Lines) that is immediately compatible with standard ML fine-tuning frameworks like the Hugging Face `datasets` library.

**3\. Documentation Deliverables:**

* **MkDocs Project Website:** A comprehensive documentation site that includes:  
  * **Installation Guide:** Instructions on how to set up the project environment, database, and dependencies.  
  * **User Guide & Tutorials:** Step-by-step guides on how to use the system, from adding documents to exporting a dataset.  
  * **SDK API Reference:** Auto-generated, detailed documentation of all public classes and functions available in the SDK.  
  * **Architectural Overview:** A brief description of the system's components and data flow.

**4\. Project Artefacts:**

* **Version-Controlled Source Code:** The complete source code hosted in a Git repository.  
* **Project Planning Documents:** The suite of documents created for this project (Summary, BRD, User Stories, etc.) serves as a reference for current and future development.
