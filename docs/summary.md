**Project Name:** SynthDataGen

**Problem Statement:** Data science and machine learning teams face a significant bottleneck in developing and fine-tuning custom Large Language Models (LLMs). The primary hurdle is the creation of high-quality, domain-specific datasets, which is a laborious, time-consuming, and often demotivating manual process. The absence of such datasets stalls projects aimed at fine-tuning, few-shot prompting, or system prompt optimization, preventing companies from leveraging their proprietary knowledge effectively.

**Proposed Solution:** The SynthDataGen project aims to automate the creation of synthetic question-answer datasets for LLM training. The system will ingest a company's internal, unstructured documents (such as PDFs and DOCX files), process their content, and use a powerful generator LLM to create relevant, context-aware question-answer pairs. These pairs will be stored in a structured database, ready for review and export, dramatically reducing the manual effort and time required for dataset creation.

**Key Features:**

* **Automated Document Ingestion:** Seamlessly pulls documents from a MinIO object store.  
* **Content Extraction & Chunking:** Extracts text from PDF and DOCX files and breaks it down into manageable, logical chunks.  
* **Context-Aware Q\&A Generation:** Intelligently groups chunks to form rich context and uses an LLM to generate high-quality question-answer pairs.  
* **Structured Storage:** Stores all generated data, metadata, and document relationships in a PostgreSQL database.  
* **Easy Data Export:** Provides a one-click export of the dataset into a JSON format suitable for fine-tuning frameworks.  
* **Developer SDK:** A Python SDK will be provided for programmatic integration into existing MLOps pipelines.

**Business Impact:**

* **Accelerate AI Development:** Drastically reduces dataset creation time from weeks to hours.  
* **Improve Model Performance:** Enables the creation of highly specialized models trained on proprietary company data.  
* **Empower Teams:** Removes a major blocker for data science teams, increasing motivation and productivity.  
* **Unlock Knowledge Assets:** Transforms static, unstructured documents into valuable, queryable training data.
